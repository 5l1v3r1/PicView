 > PicView is an Open Source Image Viewer for Windows, designed to efficiently and quickly browse through images supporting all common file formats, including `.heic`, `.hdr`, `.png`, `.jpg` & RAW camera image files. Its versatile user interface allows switching between a more traditional layout into a minimal interface, which hides the UI elements, only showing the image, with custom fading controls.
